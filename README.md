# Codex Browser Shell (Chrome Extension)

*AI Built Chrome Extension That Can Write Code to Manipulate Web Page Contents Using The Same AI API*

## Installation Instructions
**Google Chrome**
1. Clone the repository.
1. In Chrome, go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions`).
1. Enable Developer Mode.
1. Drag the `src` directory anywhere on the page to import it (do not delete the folder afterwards).

**Notes**
* This repository is just a simple code demonstration of the power of OpenAI's Codex model.
* You need to have an active OpenAI API account. If you don't, get one from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/).
* You need to add your API key to the `src/js/content.js` file.
* You can use pretty much any natural language you want as far as it is supported by OpenAI. I tested English and Arabic and both of them work fine.
* The file `openai-codex.txt` contains the used commands to generate the extension code and the generated code itself.
